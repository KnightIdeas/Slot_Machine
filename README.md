# [Simple Slot Machine:](https://knightideas.github.io/Slot_Machine/) A JavaScript Learning Project

This repository represents the journey from a guided JavaScript tutorial into an interactive, web-based slot machine game. Inspired by concepts from [Tech With Tim's](https://www.youtube.com/@TechWithTim) tutorial, ["Learn JavaScript With This ONE Project!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3XxeE7NF30), this project takes the foundational knowledge a step further.

## Overview

The project began in the 'node' directory, reflecting the original tutorial's command-line version. It was a straightforward way to understand JavaScript basics, handle user input, and run a simple, text-based slot machine game.

The evolution started with a desire to create a more user-friendly and visually engaging interface. The enhanced version in the repository's root demonstrates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript's power, transitioning from a console game to a web experience.

## Features

- **Interactive UI:** The text-based interaction is replaced with a colorful interface, complete with buttons and virtual spinning reels.
- **Balance Tracking:** The game balance is actively monitored and displayed, adding a realistic touch.
- **Custom Betting:** Users dictate their bets, teaching a lesson in risk-taking and reward.

## Learning Points

This project serves as more than a coding exercise; it embodies several learning milestones:

- **DOM Manipulation:** Experience firsthand how JavaScript interacts with the web browser, controlling elements on the page and responding to user actions.
- **Event Handling:** Understand the handling of user actions through events like button clicks.
- **Styling and Visualization:** Witness the transformation from a terminal application to a visually appealing web app through CSS.

## How to Contribute
